I haven't tested EXAM1 as it is not available for practice yet. Sorry!

Also, I implemented anteater completely on my own logic which took an entire day. So it might be hard for you to understand while the code is pretty self explanatory. If you still need help, don't hesitate to mail me. I reply to all my mails.
