As this competition has been closed, I am adding the question as well.

SumPy

Sarthak has recently started studying for internship tests, and he being a Maths + CS major wants an internship involving both concepts of mathematics and computer science.

So his interviewer gives him a simple task to perform, given two numbers L and R (L <= R) print out the sum of ALL factors of all numbers(including 1 and the number iteself) from L to R (both numbers inclusive). Your job is to help him achieve his task.

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.

The next T lines contain 2 integers each, denoting L and R.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 105

1 <= L <= R <= 106

Output Format

For every test case, print the answer i.e. the sum of factors of all numbers from L to R.

Sample Input 0

2
1 4
5 8
Sample Output 0

15
41
Explanation 0

For the first case i.e 1 to 4 we have the following factors for each number in the range. (1 : 1), (2 : 1, 2), (3 : 1, 3), (4 : 1, 2, 4)

1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 15



Code:-


#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    long long int arr[100005]={0};
    long long int arr1[100005]={0};
   
    
    for(int i=1;i<100005;i++)
    {
        for(int j=i;j<100005;j=j+i)
            arr[j]+=i;
    }
    
    
    long long int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<100004;i++)
    {
       sum+=arr[i];
       arr1[i]=sum; 
    }
    while(t--)
    {
       long long int l,r;
        cin >>l >>r;
        cout <<(arr1[r]-arr1[l-1])<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
