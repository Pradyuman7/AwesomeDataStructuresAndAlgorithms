Everything you need to know about Stacks and Queues, from important points to code and from problem solutions to text.

RD at end shows Richi's solution while PD shows Pradyuman's solution.

We'll post link for the original author's editorial or we will post our own editorial or both!
If you stil stumble, well make sure you don't. That's the point.
